- if, if-else, if-elif-else

Questions:
chatgpt should be able to answer to all of these questions. Idea is you try and understand what each of them does and practice yourself writing the programs.
1. How to pass arguments to shell script and print each of them?
2. Assuming user can pass weekday to your program. If user enters valid day, print "weekday recognized" else print "invalid weekday entered".
3. Expand program on #2 to keep asking for input until user presses Ctrl + C
4. Write a program to invoke shell command inline. For example assign current date to a variable and print the value of the variable as an example.
5. How to get the status of last command executed?
6. Write shellscript that accepts exactly one argument. If argument contains string like "day" print "found" else print "not found". Solve this using both pattern matching and regular expression.
7. How to check the number of arguments passed as input to the shell script?
